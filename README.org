Canada physical presence calculator

https://eservices.cic.gc.ca/rescalc/resCalcStartNew.do?&lang=en
explains how to determine if you meet the physical presence
requirements for citizenship in Canada.

User interface: edit
[[file:trips.csv]],
which has one line per trip outside of Canada.

Then run code in
[[file:trips.R]], which uses R data.table IDate and non-equi join to compute a
table with one row per day, and a weight column which determines how
much that day is counted.

- 0.5 for each day before permanent residence, in the year prior to
  obtaining permanent residence.
- 1 for each day you were physically present in Canada.
- 0 for each day with no physical presence in Canada.

We can implement these rules by doing a non-equi join between the
table of days, and the table of trips.

- if a day is after the day a trip starts (date>departed), 
- and before the day a trip ends (date<returned), 
- then the weight of that day should be zero.

The output of the script is a [[file:days.csv]] file for auditing, and a
summary message such as: 1096.5 days in Canada between 2024-05-30 and
2028-03-01 whereas min number required for citizenship is 1095.
